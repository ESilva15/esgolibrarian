This is a little program to help me keep my GoPro videos organized. Sometimes they get
get corrupted when doing copies, or moving or are corrupted from the get go.


The script can validate a file by running it against ffmpeg and can also
perform copies and validate them by running matching their checksum.


# Whats next
I want to make it it have persistence by modelling the data and submitting it
to a database.
